# Legal/Disclaimer üìú‚ú®

Hey there, Edge enthusiast! Before we ride into the sunset of infinite browsing, there are a few legal tidbits we've got to get off our chest.

### Not-So-Boring Trademark Stuff üè∑Ô∏è

First off, "Microsoft Edge" and the Microsoft Edge logo are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation. Our use of the name and logo is purely for illustrative and educational purposes and does not imply endorsement by Microsoft. We've got mad respect for the wizards at Microsoft, but we're not affiliated in anyway and we're not trying to stake a claim in their magical kingdom. 

So, when you see "EdgeLord" and "MSEdgeLord," remember that we're a tribute act, not the original Broadway show. We're using these names under Fair Use guidelines, but let's keep the fanfic in the realm of admiration, not appropriation, capiche?

### About That Logo üé®

We're using the Microsoft Edge logo under the MIT license as listed on Wikimedia. But let's not confuse that with Microsoft actually encouraging us to do so. It's more like community karaoke than an opening act. [Where did you get that?](https://web.archive.org/web/20230925060629/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edge_Logo_2019.svg)

### One More Thing: Software Shenanigans üõ†Ô∏è

While we put our heart and soul (mostly code) into EdgeLord, please note that [DOSYAGO Corporation](https://dosyago.com) isn't responsible for any damage, loss of data, or dimensional rifts that may occur while using the project. You get to run Microsoft Edge on a random server somewhere in the cloud‚Äîthat's the deal. Anything beyond that, you're on your own, adventurer!
