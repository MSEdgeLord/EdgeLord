# EdgeLord

## Description

Meet EdgeLord. This project takes Microsoft Edge, wraps it, and turns it into a full-stack web application. Because why browse locally when you can run Edge on a random server somewhere in the cloud?

## Features

- **Headless Horseman**: Microsoft Edge in headless mode, but not nearly as scary.
- **Browser Inception**: Browse using a browser within a browser, just like in that movie you keep saying you understood.
- **Automate All the Things**: Fully controlled via GitHub Actions, because clicking is so 2020.
- **The Quick and the Dead**: 10-minute browser sessions to live fast, browse young, and leave a good-looking cache.

## Requirements

- A GitHub account (If you don't have one, how did you even get here?)
- Familiarity with GitHub Actions or a willingness to wing it.

## Installation

1. **Fork or Template**: Navigate to the [EdgeLord GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/edgelord) and fork it. Or use it as a template if you're not into commitment.
  
2. **Click Things**: GitHub Actions should be enabled. If not, click on the "Actions" tab until it's on.

3. **Open an Issue**: To fuel the EdgeLord engine, go ahead and open an issue titled "To the Edge." It takes about 5 minutes for the alchemy to occur and turn basic code into headless browsing gold. Once complete, a mysterious URL will appear in the issue comments. Click it, but remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

ðŸ”„ *Re-run the Magic*: Need to restart your browsing session? Just reopen the "To the Edge" issue, and the EdgeLord shall rise again, ready to serve your browsing needs or fuel your procrastination.

## How to Use

1. **Summon the EdgeLord**: Open an issue titled "Run EdgeLord" and watch the dark magic happen.
  
2. **URL is the New LOL**: We'll send you a URL. It's not spam, we promise.

3. **Clock's Ticking**: Finish your browsing ritual before the 10-minute sand timer runs out. No pressure.
