# *Special Event!* ðŸ¤™ Create a private ephemeral Web Proxy hosted on your GitHub Actions minutes by opening an issue on this repo

**HOLD UP** You need to [fork](../../fork) or [generate](../../generate) this repo first, so you have your own copy. Then open an issue and you will be guided through the process (1 manual step, rest is automatic), while your browser VPN is created. 

By default they remain open for 5 minutes, but you can make that longer by editing the workflow YAML file. Each minute used counts against your GitHub actions quota. Also, don't do anything abusive with this, remember you are browsing the web from inside GitHub's infrastructure (actions runners), so treat them with respect!

Limitations: no audio, no DevTools, no docviewer (Because the ports are not accesible, although the services are running)

***DOSY***

**P.S** want a real VPN? Then check out [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) (no affiliation). They also have a Mullvad Browser!

# EdgeLord

# Web application virtualization via Zero Trust Remote Browser Isolation and Secure Document Gateway

EdgeLord is a leading-edge solution in the Zero Trust landscape, enabling embeddable multiplayer browsers in any web page on any device. Our cybersecurity focus is on ensuring that every web interaction is treated as potentially hostile, and isolating it, so that we protect your devices and network from harm. 

By leveraging the principles of Remote Browser Isolation (RBI), real-time streaming and collaborative browserin (co-browsing or "multiplayer browsers"), EdgeLordPro ensures that no web content directly interacts with the end user's device, while remaining accessible through a shareable, collaborative interface. 

This guide will walk you through the seamless integration of EdgeLordPro into your Zero Trust architecture.

***NOTE: If you are installing on MacOS please be aware that performance will be very slow because headless Chrome on MacOS is ['fake headless' (just a hidden window) because of limitations of the MacOS ecosystem faced by the Chrome authors](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/3938#issuecomment-469332659).***

## Deploying EdgeLordPro in a Zero Trust Environment with Docker

Before diving in, ensure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed!

Deploying EdgeLordPro within a Zero Trust framework is straightforward:

1. Obtain the latest Docker container for EdgeLordPro from our [packages page](https://github.com/dosyago/EdgeLordPro/pkgs/container/browserboxpro) on GitHub Container Registry.

2. Deploy the Docker container using our Zero Trust compliant run script. Choose a primary port number (`$PORT`) ensuring two extra ports are free both preceding and succeeding `$PORT`. Deploy by running:

```console
PORT=8080 # or your preferred port
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosyago/EdgeLordPro/7461dd1edb5e9e5b4f44da8961228e66cdcdf276/deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh) $PORT
```

Upon successful deployment, EdgeLordPro will be operational, reinforcing your Zero Trust strategy. Access the browser using the provided login link: `https://<your-host>:$PORT/login?token=<random token>`.

## Zero Trust Installation Guide

**ðŸŒŸ Video Installation Guide for Pro: [https://youtu.be/cGUJCCPDWNE](https://youtu.be/cGUJCCPDWNE)**

For detailed information and progress updates, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/dosyago/EdgeLord).

## Installation

Follow these instructions to install EdgeLordPro on your system.

### Initial Machine Setup

Before installing EdgeLordPro, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Debian VPS with 1 cores, 1 GB RAM, and 25 GB SSD (e.g. Nanode from Linode)
- At least 5 Mbps internet connection
- A public hostname with a DNS A record pointing to your VPS's IP address, or localhost certificates installed on your local and remote machine (for example using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert))

First, update your distribution:

`apt update && apt -y upgrade`

And install a few basic tools:

`apt install curl git wget`

Now, prepare the machine by following these steps:

1. Create a new user to operate EdgeLordPro:
   ```
   adduser pro
   ```

2. Disable the password for the newly created user:
   ```
   usermod -L pro
   ```

3. Create a new group for sudo privileges:
   ```
   addgroup sudoers
   ```

4. Add the following line to the sudoers file to avoid entering a password for sudo operations:
   ```
   %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   ```
   Use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file.

5. Grant sudo privileges to the user:
   ```
   usermod -G sudoers pro
   ```

Switch to the `pro` user by executing the following command:
```
sudo -u pro bash
```

### Installation Process

Follow these steps to install EdgeLordPro:

1. Clone the EdgeLordPro repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dosyago/EdgeLordPro
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd EdgeLordPro
   ```

3. Run the global installation script, replacing `<domain_name>` with your domain name that points to the machine you're setting up (if you want to use it without a domain name, just use localhost here for the domain name, but you'll still need to copy the correct mkcert localsthost certificates to $HOME/sslcerts later):
   ```
   ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh <domain_name>
   ```

4. Start the main service on port 8080 and generate the login link:
   ```
   setup_bbpro --port 8080
   ```

5. Launch EdgeLordPro:
   ```
   bbpro
   ```

During the installation process, EdgeLordPro will automatically install the required dependencies and configure the necessary settings.

*Please note that we cannot transact with sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.* 

Commercial Licenses are priced per seat. A seat is someone who uses the EdgeLord Pro system, either in an internal application (like secure email attachment viewing), or an external customer-facing application (such as a customer of your remote browser isolation product). Commercial Licenses come in two flavors:

- **Perpetual License** This is a license to use the version of EdgeLord Pro you purchase forever. The version can be updated to the latest via purchase of yearly licenses.
- **Yearly License** This is a license to use the latest version available within the 12-months from your purchase. It can be manually renewed every year, or you can subscribe so it renews automatically.

Commercial Licenses are available in two sizes:

- **Individual License** Purchasable at [our GumRoad site](https://dosyo.gumroad.com). This is suitable for individuals or small teams working on commercial projects who don't want to use the AGPLv3.
- **License Pack** Available in multiple sizes, from the small to the truly epic, with commensurately epic discounts at scale. These are purchasable at [our main website](https://dosyago.com).

By obtaining a commercial license, you gain the freedom to tailor EdgeLord Pro to your specific requirements and integrate it seamlessly into your workflow. This empowers organizations to leverage the advanced features and capabilities of EdgeLord Pro while maintaining full control over its customization and usage. 

Support tiers and customization may be separately negotiated and purchased. To discuss your needs, please [reach out to our helpful support team here](mailto:support@dosyago.com?subject=EdgeLord%20Pro).

### Hardware Appliance (OEM) Licensing

[Contact us for special access to Appliance License pricing with Volume Discounts](mailto:sales@dosyago.com?subject=OEM%20License). This pricing sheet and terms are tailored to suit OEM's delivering security products for business and industry. Please note that if you are supplying government or other non-commercial users you cannot "pass through" DOSYAGO's non-commercial license to your customers without licensing a Commercial license from us. 

### Sanctions Compliance

Unfotunately if you or your company are an OFAC sanctioned entity or other entity sanctioned by the US Government (e.g. designated on OFAC's SDN List, BIS's DPL or Entity List, DDTC's DPL, or on the FBI's various lists, among others) we are unable to offer you a license of any form. Please note that in some cases we may conduct necessary checks to ensure sanctions compliance.

EdgeLord Pro offers flexible licensing options to cater to different usage scenarios. As previously mentioned, BBPro software is available for free for non-commercial use under the PolyForm NonCommercial license. This allows individuals and non-profit organizations to enjoy the benefits of EdgeLord Pro without any licensing fees when using the software without any participation in or anticipation of commercial application. The PolyForm NonCommercial license ensures that the software is used strictly for non-commercial purposes.
