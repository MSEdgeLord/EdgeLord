# EdgeLord

## Description

Meet EdgeLord. This project takes Microsoft Edge, wraps it, and turns it into a full-stack web application. Because why browse locally when you can run Edge on a random server somewhere in the cloud?

## Features

- **Headless Horseman**: Microsoft Edge in headless mode, but not nearly as scary.
- **Browser Inception**: Browse using a browser within a browser, just like in that movie you keep saying you understood.
- **Automate All the Things**: Fully controlled via GitHub Actions, because clicking is so 2020.
- **The Quick and the Dead**: 10-minute browser sessions to live fast, browse young, and leave a good-looking cache.

## Requirements

- A GitHub account (If you don't have one, how did you even get here?)
- Familiarity with GitHub Actions or a willingness to wing it.

## Installation

1. **Fork or Template**: Navigate to the [EdgeLord GitHub repository](https://github.com/MSEdgeLord/EdgeLord) and fork it. Or use it as a template if you're not into commitment.
  
2. **Click Things**: GitHub Actions should be enabled. If not, click on the "Actions" tab until it's on.

3. **Open an Issue**: To fuel the EdgeLord engine, go ahead and open an issue titled "To the Edge." It takes about 5 minutes for the alchemy to occur and turn basic code into headless browsing gold. Once complete, a mysterious URL will appear in the issue comments. Click it, but remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

üîÑ *Re-run the Magic*: Need to restart your browsing session? Just reopen the "To the Edge" issue, and the EdgeLord shall rise again, ready to serve your browsing needs or fuel your procrastination.

## How to Use

1. **Summon the EdgeLord**: Open an issue titled "Run EdgeLord" and watch the dark magic happen.
  
2. **URL is the New LOL**: We'll send you a URL. It's not spam, we promise.

3. **Clock's Ticking**: Finish your browsing ritual before the 10-minute sand timer runs out. No pressure.

## License

Multiply license. Because sharing is caring, but also legally binding. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for legalese.

Certainly! Adding a legal section that's both informative and fun can be a challenge, but let's give it a try. You'll want to cover your bases when it comes to using Microsoft's name and logo. Here's how you might add a "Legal/Disclaimer" section to your README.

## Legal/Disclaimer üìú‚ú®

Hey there, Edge enthusiast! Before we ride into the sunset of infinite browsing, there are a few legal tidbits we've got to get off our chest.

### Not-So-Boring Trademark Stuff üè∑Ô∏è

First off, "Microsoft Edge" and the Microsoft Edge logo are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation. Our use of the name and logo is purely for illustrative and educational purposes and does not imply endorsement by Microsoft. We've got mad respect for the wizards at Microsoft, but we're not affiliated in any way, and we're not trying to stake a claim in their magical kingdom. 

So, when you see "EdgeLord" and "MSEdgeLord," remember that we're a tribute act, not the original Broadway show. We're using these names under Fair Use guidelines, but let's keep the fanfic in the realm of admiration, not appropriation, capiche?

### About That Logo üé®

We're using the Microsoft Edge logo under the MIT license as listed on Wikimedia. But let's not confuse that with Microsoft actually encouraging us to do so. It's more like community karaoke than an opening act.

### One More Thing: Software Shenanigans üõ†Ô∏è

While we put our heart and soul (mostly code) into EdgeLord, please note that DOSYAGO Corporation isn't responsible for any damage, loss of data, or dimensional rifts that may occur while using the project. You get to run Microsoft Edge on a random server somewhere in the cloud‚Äîthat's the deal. Anything beyond that, you're on your own, adventurer!
