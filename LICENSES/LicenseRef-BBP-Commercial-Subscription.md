This Yearly Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is between you (both the individual accessing the Software and any single legal entity for which the individual is acting) (“You” or “Your”) and DOSYAGO, (“DOSYAGO”), a company organized under the laws of Delaware, for the BrowserBox Pro software product.

## 1. Grant of License

1.1 Subject to Your compliance with the terms of this Agreement and possession of a valid Order Receipt, DOSYAGO grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the BrowserBox Pro software product (“Software”) for a period of 12 months from the Effective Date. 

1.2 You may use the Software in as many commercial applications as you like and in your own commercial applications and products, including but not limited to premium VPN services, RBI systems, system integration portals, web automation and scraping products, educational platforms, and other products and apps.

1.3 Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license, so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with BrowserBox Pro.

## 2. Seats

2.1 A "seat" under this Agreement refers to a logical seat and represents the entitlement of one concurrent user to use the Software at any given time across all applications in which the Software is utilized. It is important to note that a seat represents the total number of concurrent users across all applications, and not one seat per application. You may reassign seats between different users, applications, or machines, but each seat may only be used by one user at a time.

2.2 The number of seats licensed under this Agreement and the confirmation of purchase, including the license code, will be included in the attached Order Receipt. This Agreement, together with the valid Order Receipt/s, constitutes your License.

## 3. Support and Maintenance

3.1 This Agreement includes basic initial deployment support equivalent to 1 full day (8 hours) per pack of 1000 licenses or proportional amounts thereof. It also includes updates and critical bug patches for the term of the license.

3.2 Additional support, customization, and maintenance tiers can be negotiated and purchased separately. Contact sales@dosyago.com to discuss your needs.

4.1 The Software may collect data necessary to ensure the operation of the Software, any services it employs, and compliance with any restrictions.

## 5. Limitations

5.1 The Software may be used for any lawful purpose. Any use of the Software for an unlawful purpose or in an unlawful manner is strictly prohibited and shall result in the immediate termination of this Agreement.

## 6. Amendments to Terms

6.1 DOSYAGO may update these terms from time to time. You will be bound by any updated terms. In case such updated terms would be unlawful or contradictory to apply to your license, your existing license will prevail for the remainder of the 12-month period, and thereafter, any renewals will be governed by the updated terms.

## 7. No Transfer

7.1 You may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the license granted hereunder, or rent or lease the Software to any third party.

## 8. Violation and Termination

8.1 If You provide copies of the Software to others in an illegal manner or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement, Your license is terminated immediately, and You are liable for any damages or losses incurred by DOSYAGO or any third party as a result.

## 9. Governing Law

9.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

 the entire agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral.

## 11. Severability

11.1 If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, it shall be excluded from this Agreement, and the balance of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
