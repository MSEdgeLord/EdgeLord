# You're about to make a VPN!

Ensure you have [forked](../fork) or [generated](../generate) this repo to your own account (not an org account) first, and then all you need to do is click the **Submit New Issue** button and follow the steps that show up in the issues comments below.

Your [BrowserBox](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox) ephemeral private VPN will then be created. Follow any prompts that arise in the comments here and you'll be soon browsing the web securely and privately!

(*Rest assured, the VPN only kicks in when you, as repo owner, open or reopen the issue. No random person can switch it on and use up your actions minutes. The only exception is my username, which can trigger it solely for the purpose of supporting or debugging any problems you face. Feel free to revoke by editing the `userjob.yaml` workflow if you're concerned about your minutes being misused!*)

The next comment will show up below soon after you click **Submit New Issue**
